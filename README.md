# Simple_Timed_Popup_JQUERY_PHP
Website popup using Jquery_Ajax_PHP to display anything
A simple way to display popup on your website. The timestamp stored as string in localstorage. Anytime a user opens the webpage (index or any page you desire) the current timestamp checks against the stored timestamp and finds the difference if it is greater or equal to what you must have set (say 15 days) to display a popup. Since we are using ajax, the popup file must have been design in form of a modal or any simple popup design.
